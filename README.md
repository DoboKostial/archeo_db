The 'archeo_db' project is a database layer modeling for a field database of facts of destructive 
archaeological research (excavation research). It is conceptually based on a general analysis of 
research and definition of research entities:

here ENG - https://archeoconsult.org/good-data/good-data-internal/excavation-docu-standard/

here SK - https://archeoconsult.org/good-data/good-data-internal/standard-terenneho-vyskumu-a-jeho-dokumentacie-sk/

It is not a specialized database, but of general use (universal archaeological terain excavation) and created in 
PostgreSQL environment - hence relation standard.
